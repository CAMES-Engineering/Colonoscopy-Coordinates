# Colonoscope Coordinates Dataset

## Overview

Colonoscopy is a endoscopic technique of the large bowel, many AI solutions exists for the imaging part. However, until now, no publicly available database has existed that includes the colonoscopeâ€™s spatial coordinates, allowing for mapping with timestamps to trace the colonoscope path through the colon over the procedure.

The colonoscope contains electromagnetic coils that provide position data through magnetic endoscopic imaging. Such data have previously been used to develop the Colonoscopy Retraction Score (which correlates with the adenoma detection rate) and the Colonoscopy Progression Score (which correlates with patient-experienced pain).

In this repository, we provide code examples to a dataset consisting of:

- **1399 Clinical Colonoscopies**: Real-world data from clinical procedures.
- **100 Simulated Colonoscopies**: Standardized data from a simulated environment.

These data are freely available to researchers and developers at [DOI DATA]. Potential applications include:

- Mapping the inspection of the colon.
- Defining and tracking typical motion patterns.
- Generating heatmaps to ensure equally distributed inspection.

## Contents

This repository contains code examples for utilizing the dataset effectively. Some key applications of the dataset include:

- **Colonoscope Path Mapping**: Visualizing the movement of the colonoscope through the colon over time.
- **Heatmap Generation**: Creating heatmaps to visualize coverage of the colon during endoscopy

## Dataset Description
See [DOI] and [DOI Data]
- **Clinical Colonoscopies**: 1400 procedures, including timestamped coordinate data for mapping the colonoscope path in real-world settings.
- **Simulated Colonoscopies**: 100 procedures from a standardized simulated environment, providing a controlled reference for analysis and development.
